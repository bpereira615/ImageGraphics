“Discuss your process for implementing this part of the assignment, including which team members worked on which classes and tests, and why you chose that particular approach in your README file for this assignment.”

Included Files:

Distance.java
GVertex.java
GVertexTest.java
P4C.java
Partition.java
Pixel.java
PixelDistance.java
PQHeap.java
QueueEmptyException.java
StoreInfo.java
WEdge.java
WGraphP4.java
WGraphP4Test.java


GVertex.java was worked on by Lydia. Originally there were some issues with generics and implementing Comparable properly so that it could be used in the later-written PQHeap class, but this was fixed. Each vertex holds a list of neighboring vertices as well as a list of incident edges. 
WEdge.java was worked on by Ryan and Ben. Again, troubles properly using generics were had, but then were fixed in tandem with writing part B of the project.
